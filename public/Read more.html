    <my second year of college i started a business Analysis module which made me develop more love and passion of analysing<br> and coming up with solution for problems enconted by businesess which felt<br>  like a dream come true because when i grew up i've always wanted to be a business women but i also had<br>  big love for computers and programming, so being a business analyst with Information Technolgy background<br>  became my new dream and passion.</p> 
     I am currently a COBOL-MAINFRAME programmer at Capaciti at the Braamfontein campus.<br>  i am a programmer with a passion for creating and analysing interactive and user-friendly website.<br>  In my collge years i got the opportunity to learn a few languages such as html ,javaScript,css</p>
